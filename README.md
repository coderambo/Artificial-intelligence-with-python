# Artificial intelligence with python


Project1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share usres on a given day.

Project2: Dog Breed Classifier
Define a Convolutional Neural Network that performs better than the average human when given the task:identifying dog breeds.Given a image of a dog, this algorithm will produce an estimate of the dog's breed.

Project3:Generate TV Scripts
Build Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch.Perform sentiment analysis and generate new text,and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.

Project4:Generate Faces
Implement a Deep Convolutional GAN,generate realistic images of faces.

Project5:User Churn Prediction
In this project, we use supervised learning models to identify customers who are likely to stop using service in the future. Furthermore, we will analyze top factors that influence user retention.

Project6:Document Clustering and Topic Modeling
In this project, we use unsupervised learning models to cluster unlabeled documents into different groups, visualize the results and identify their latent topics/structures.
