# Artificial intelligence with python


Project1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bike-share usres on a given day.

Project2: Dog Breed Classifier
Define a Convolutional Neural Network that performs better than the average human when given the task:identifying dog breeds.Given a image of a dog, this algorithm will produce an estimate of the dog's breed.

Project3:Generate TV Scripts
Build Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch.Perform sentiment analysis and generate new text,and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.

Project4:Generate Faces
Implement a Deep Convolutional GAN,generate realistic images of faces.
